## Better Living through Better Engineering

 A true follower of Atomic Habits and constantly working to create superior habits and systems that provide more energy, clarity, organization, mental & physical health, total freedom as I build projects to power a a better engineered world. 

### Project & Learning Motivations

I'm constantly trying different development patterns, technologies, tools, and frameworks as I refine my own ability to create, style, and refactor engineering projects. The styling and formatting can vary greatly between projects, but each has strong internal formatting consistency. The listed projects are primarily learning demonstrations for potential employers and myself, and are currently formatted for my own readability. I'm very familiar with utilizng team formatting tools (Prettier/EsLint/popular style guides) and can easily output code in any style format requested of me.

### Tech Stack

Preferred Tech: Next.js(12 is awesome), React(16.8+ hooks), Functional TypeScript/JavaScript ES6+(can work with OOP if needed), Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, Figma design, CSS3, HTML5+, FullStack-MERN, Node.js, MongoDB, Sanity, Git/Github, Firebase(Auth), auth0, BitBucket, Jira

Learned Tech: OOP JavaScript, SQL database queries, Redux Toolkit, Redux Thunk

### Future Learning and Growth Plans

Top education initiatives are... 
  - Improving TypeScript proficiency as it's truly the best tool for JavaScript-based team development.
  - Working to deploy more FullStack applications and increase Node.js/Backend proficiency.
  - Constantly growing web security knowledge for both my projects and personal/family well-being.
  - Dive into WEB 3.0 technologies - OpenSea, Solidity, MetaMask, Blockchain, Smart Contracts.
